    "# I. Regularized Linear Models\n",
    "We've discussed over-fitting concerns. One way to mitigate overfitting (a.k.a. regularize a model) is to trim down the number of involved inputs. At a high level, \"regularizing models\" means making predictive models more accurate through simplification i.e. __reducing error on training data by dropping redundant inputs__. These are the 3 models, but we'll save the math examples for later:\n",
