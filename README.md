# I. Author's Context
I've held leadership roles in numerous VC-backed tech startups, but:
  - they were all __business__ roles (finance, COO, product)
  - I have no CS degree
  - have never undergone a coding bootcamp
<br>
After building some CRUD web apps and ETL pipelines, I'm upskilling in __Applied ML Engineering__. An ex-Google dev showed me an industry standard ML book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646) by Aurelien Geron:

| 7       | Combining models             | Ensemble Learning                 | Not Started             |
| 8       | Reducing dataset complexity  | Dimensionality Reduction          | Not Started             |
| 9       | Grouping similar data points | Clustering, Unsupervised Learning | Not Started             |

# II. What is this?
This project is less of a deliverable for others and more of a forcing function for me to understand:
- the hierarchy of ML tactics, specifically supervised learning
- defining those tactics and understand how they compare/contrast
- how to optimize
