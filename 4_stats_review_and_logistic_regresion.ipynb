    "#### A) Correlation\n",
    "- Represented as *\"R\"*\n",
    "- Shows the strength of relationship, not causality, between 2 linear trends\n",
    "\n",
    "#### B) Variance\n",
    "- Represented as *\"Sigma-squared\"*\n",
    "- Quantifies the the model's error, the disparity between predictions and actuals.\n",
    "- I'm guessing this is similar to \"cost function\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### C) Coefficient of Determination\n",
    "- Represented as *\"R-squared\"*\n",
    "- At first glance, this seems pointless because you'd think it ties directly to (A) Correlation.\n",
    "- This shows how much of (B) Variance is dictated by an input variable, which is relevant in a more complex, non-linear model with multiple variables.\n",
    "- It's possible for an input variable to be strongly correlated (high R), but still play a minor role (low R-Squared) in predicting outputs. Clean and understandable relationships can be overshadowed by stronger factors or confounding variables. For example:\n",
    "  - __PREDICTING HOW ATTRACTIVE A GUY IS TO GIRLS__\n",
    "    - In a vacuum, women generally find a guy less attractive the more video games he plays.\n",
    "    - However, a girl's repulsion often immediately goes out the window if the guy:\n",
    "      - is tall\n",
    "      - has a good income\n",
    "      - is a colorful storyteller\n",
    "    - Therefore, (lack of) video game activity is an example of something with <u>strong correlation</u>, but <u>low __coefficient of determination__</u> in predicting how attractive a guy is to girls\n",
    "\n",
    "#### D) Covariance\n",
    "- Represented as *\"Cov(X,Y)\"* when discussing the relationship between X and Y\n",
    "- Shows directionality:\n",
    "  - a positive covariance means factors increase together (housing prices grow with square footage)\n",
    "  - a negative covariance means 1 factor shrinks while the other grows (a guy's level of attractiveness shrinks as his video game consumption goes up)"
